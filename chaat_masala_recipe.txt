Recipe for Chaat Masala/Dahi Bada Masala

Roast and Grind Cumin Seeds: Take 100 grams of cumin seeds. Roast them and then grind them into a powder. (The woman specifies that if you don't have a scale, you can use a small bowl for measurement).

Add Salt and Spices: Add the following ingredients to the ground cumin:

1/4 bowl of black salt

1/4 bowl of white salt

1/8 bowl of black pepper (Kali Mircha)

Add Garam Masala: Add an amount of garam masala equal to the amount of black pepper (1/8 bowl). (The woman mentions that she grinds her own garam masala from spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, and mace, but for this recipe, a pre-made mix is acceptable).

Add Dried Mango Powder (Amchur): Add dried mango powder (amchur) in an amount equal to the black pepper (1/8 bowl).

Add Red Chili Powder: Add red chili powder (Lal Mircha) in an amount half of the black pepper (1/16 bowl).

Mix and Grind: Put all the ingredients in a blender and grind them until they are a fine powder.

Store: Store the powder in an airtight container to preserve its aroma.

The woman mentions that this spice mix can be used for both chaat and dahi bada, but that chaat masala typically has a bit more tanginess than dahi bada masala.
